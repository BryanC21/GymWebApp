Dedicated channels such as backend, data holds crucial records for project management

[Third week] While revising the plan for the project, we made sure to remove any uncertain features such as chatbot activation pertaining to the project. We gave more importance to the Information related to log activities and other functions that are easy to navigate and interpret.

### Feedback :dart: 

[Fifth week] We emphasized feedback loops to actively seek suggestions on the developments of the project. We regularly shared our progress to gain insights and knowledge transfer via our weekly zoom calls and share our updates in the Project journal and the Confluence page.

We have meticulously maintained Project journal that keeps track of weekly scrum reports for progress. Each team member has owned atleast one component in the project, supporting and learning from each other with sense of diligence and stewardship.
